# autofinger

Python module for generating automatic piano fingering.
It currently uses a [dumb] genetic algorithm and it is far from from being complete. Obviously it's here just for my convenience
but feel free to contact me if you find something useful, which I doubt you'll do, and want more information or 
updated code.

## Current Development

I've had no satisfactory success using the genetic algorithm so I'll be trying, over the next days, to implement a more 
sophisticated algorithm based on Hidden Markov Models (as described in the best reference paper about this problem 
that I'll cite later). 

Naturally I didn't think that genetic algorithms would've been good enough because our objective function is
too complex and with no easy formula. But it was very easy to implement and it is nice to have an almost working 
environment before trying more complex algorithms (under XP spirit).

for my English. It's not my native language and it's been a pretty long time since I wrote something in it.
